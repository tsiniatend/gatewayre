       <h2>CULTURAL COFFEE</h2>
     
     <!-- Create div for info dump on locations, css to make it look better and smaller for the picture youll add later --> 
       <div class="infodump">
          <p> The beautiful and unique coffee ceremony is a tradition in Ethiopia which takes time to celebrate friendship, hospitality, and respect. It begins by spreading fresh flowers on the ground, while burning incense to make the air more fragrant. The coffee beans are then brewed in a traditional mortar before putting them in a "Jebena." Don't be in a hurry though - this special ceremony can take a few hours. While it isn't as fast or modern as Starbucks, the coffee is just the centerpiece of an elegant ceremony meant to be shared with family and guests.

       <h2>VEGAN VARIETY</h2>
      <div class="infodump">
          <p>Ethiopian food is one of the world’s most flavourful cuisines. It is also extremely welcoming to vegans because of the countries blending of many herbs and grains into meals. Though just like their Coffee Cermonies, Ethiopians have a strong sense of community which is displayed in their communal style of eating. This is usually present in the form of thick, rich, spicy wat (stews), seasoned sauteed vegetables, sauces, and salads served on large pieces of injera (sourdough flatbread) for multiple people to eat.
